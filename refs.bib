abstract = "A model-based approach to detect and isolate non-concurrent multiple leaks in a pipeline is proposed, only using pressure and flow sensors placed at the pipeline ends. The approach relies on a nonlinear modeling derived from Water–Hammer equations, and related Extended Kalman Filters used to estimate leak coefficients. This extends former results developed for the single leak case, but with the difficulty that the model is modified at each new leak occurrence. A model adaptation strategy is thus proposed, allowing us to monitor indeed each new leak, and no matter where it appears. Experimental results illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm."

abstract = "This paper proposes a methodology for leak detection and isolation (LDI) in pipelines based on data fusion from two approaches: a steady-state estimation and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The proposed method considers only pressure head and flow rate measurements at the pipeline ends, which contain intrinsic sensor and process noise. The LDI system is tested in real-time by using an USB data acquisition device that is implemented in MATLAB environment. The effectiveness of the method is analyzed by considering: online detection, location as well as quantification of non-concurrent leaks at different positions. The leak estimation error average is less than 1 of the flow rate and less than 3 in the leakage position. Furthermore, the incorporation of a steady-state estimation shows that the solution of the LDI problem has improved significantly with respect to the one that only considers the EKF estimation. An experimental analysis was also performed on the effectiveness of the proposed approach for different sampling rates and for different leakage positions."
